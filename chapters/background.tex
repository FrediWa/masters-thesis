% Fourier Analysis Introduction
In the beginning of the 1800s, Joseph Fourier was working on a physics problem called the heat equation, a certain partial differential equation. He had the idea of expressing the original function as a sum of sine and cosine functions as these would integrate and differentiate easily, making the differential equation easier to solve. He eventually developed and introduced the idea of Fourier series, a way of expressing a function as a sum of trigonometric functions \cite{Bounchaleun2019}.
% Fourier Series
\subsubsection{Fourier Series} 
If a function has a period of $2\pi$, the Fourier series takes the form $$f(t) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_ncos(nt)+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_nsin(nt)$$ and states that a function can be represented by an infinite number of sine and cosine waves with different magnitudes and coefficients, plus some constant term. Using this representation and a the properties of a few integrals of trigonometric functions, one can derive formulae for $a_0$, $a_n$ and $b_n$.

As an example, the following series $$\pi -2sin(x) -sin(2x) -\frac{2}{3}sin(3x) -\frac{1}{2}sin(4x) ... $$ is a sort of sawtooth wave. As a sawtooth wave is essentially just $f(x) = x$ over some interval it's relatively easy to compute the coefficients using the derived formulae. The same goes for the square and triangle waves, althought the triangle wave might be more difficult to calculate analytically.
 
% Fourier Transform
\subsubsection{Fourier Transform} 
The Fourier Transform is a operation that finds components that may be used to build a Fourier series. Formally it takes a function in time-domain (a signal as a function of time, like a sound) and outputs a function in frequency-domain, a kind of description for which kinds of sinusoids make up the original signal \cite{SimonXu2015}. Figure \ref{fig:transform} shows a signal and what it would look like in the frequency domain. If one added up the frequencies at the spikes in the frequency-domain (using the inverse of the Fourier transform), one would get back a very similar looking function to the original signal but without the noise. Unlike the Fourier series which works on periodic functions, the transform can be used to find the coefficients for non-periodic functions.

    \caption{Some signal in the time-domain (displayed on the left) with added noise. Computing the transform with a discrete version of the Fourier transform reveals the main frequencies that make up the original signal in the time-domain (displayed on the right)\label{fig:transform}}
\end{figure}

Even though the the FT is an incredibly powerful function, its formula is compact. 
$$\hat{f}(\zeta) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)e^{-i2\pi\zeta t} dt$$
The variable $\zeta$ is used here to emphasize that the output is complex. It's also worth noting at this point that "transform" refers both to the act of transforming the function between domains but sometimes also the output values are called the transform.

% Is the CFT a purely theoretical framework? Even using software that can compute analytically, we need to express the signal in some way. How?

% DFT
\subsection{Discrete fourier transform} 
The Discrete Fourier transform (abbreviated as DFT), as the name implies, is the Fourier transform for discrete signals. Instead of integrating over the entire function domain, we sum the samples from the signal starting from the start of the signal at $t=0$ to some $t=N$. The DFT for a signal $x$ with $N$ points is 
$$X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_ne^{-\frac{i2\pi kn}{N}}$$

% Matrix
\subsubsection{Matrix representation for the DFT computations} 
The DFT can be represented and computed by a matrix-vector multiplication.

    X(0) \\

\end{bmatrix}

    x(1) \\
    x(2) \\
    x(3) \\

\end{bmatrix}
$$
where $n = N-1$ as the computation are zero-indexed and $\omega$ is the principle fifth root of unity $e^{2\pi i/5} $. 
% but why a matrix when the summation formula is both practical and more compact..?

% Inverse transform
\subsection{Inverse Transforms}
The time-domain signal can be used, transmitted, received, but is hard to work with. The frequency-domain on the other hand is easy to work in, but makes little to no sense in many use cases. A C-major chord in frequency-domain can not be played, for example. The Fourier transform allows the transformation from time to frequency domain, but once any modification (like high frequency filtering) is applied, the signal needs to be transformed back to time-domain in order to be useful. The operation that does this is appropriately called the inverse Fourier transform, IFT for short or IDFT, for the discrete variant.

The inverse Fourier transform is very similar to the FT:
$$ f(t) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\zeta)e^{i2\pi\zeta t} d\zeta$$
the discrete inverse transform (which should be called DIFT instead of IDFT) is 
$$ x_n = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X(k)e^{\frac{i2\pi kn}{N}}$$

% Computing
\subsection{Computations}
\subsubsection{Example DFT using the formula}
Even thought it's tedious, the formula is easy to use both in manual computations and when writing software for it. Given a discrete input signal $x = [-0.01298834,  0.62287525,  0.64266088,  0.39309558,  0.55407458, \cdots , -0.55613981, -0.55769558]$ which has a 100 elements, the DFT values can be computed with the formula $$X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_ne^{-\frac{i2\pi kn}{N}}$$. Starting with $k=0$ $X_0 \approx -0.3215+0i$ (rounded, the transform computes the exakt) a number with both the real and imaginary components close to 0, which indicates very little impact on the original signal. At $k=5$ however, $X_k \approx 0.07725-24.5836i$ with a relatively large imaginary component. Repeating the same summation up to $k=100-1 = 99$ the other values of $X_k$ with relatively large imaginary componets are at $k=12$ and $k=25$. 

To get the frequency-magnitude plot, the magnitudes for each $X_k$ are needed. The magnitude is the argument (lenght of the equivalent vector) of the DFT values and as a vector forms a right triangle, the length of the vector, or hypotenuse of the triangle can be computed with the Pythagorean theorem $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. 
\subsubsection{Computing DFT with a programming language}
Implementing the DFT in Python, with its built-in complex data types and extensive mathematical and scientific computing libraries, is trivial. Leveraging Python's cmath library, the computations can be copied directly and 2 for-loops handles the summation and $X_k$ indexing as shown in figure \ref{fig:pyDFT}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/pyDFT.png}
    \caption{Implementing the DFT in Python is trivial and can almost be directly copied from the formula by utilizing Python's cmath library for complex exponentiation \label{fig:pyDFT}}
\end{figure}

For a more primitive language like C, without complex exponentiation, the computations are still fairly straightforward to do thanks to Euler's formula that expands $e^{ix} = cos(x) + isin(x)$.  

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/cDFT.png}
    \caption{Implementing the DFT in C is still relatively easy thanks to Euler's formula. \label{fig:cDFT}}
\end{figure}

These examples are purely illustrative, there's no reason to implement the DFT because an FFT does the same transformation, just with less computations, and the difference just grows with the sample size.
\subsubsection{Computing the inverse}
Writing the inverse discrete Fourier transform in Python is as straightforward as the DFT due to the cmath library, but an additional normalization is added as shown in figure \ref{fig:IDFT}. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/IDFT.png}
    \caption{Implementing the IDFT in Python is as easy as the DFT. After the summation, each term is then scaled down by the signal length. \label{fig:IDFT}}
\end{figure}

The signal that we are turning back to the time-domain is filtered very naively for demonstration purposes. The filter turns unimportant frequencies (components with a magnitude less than 2) to 0. Figure \ref{fig:DFT-IDFT} shows both the original signal and filtered signal in both time and frequency-domain.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/filtered_signal.png}
    \caption{The time-domain and frequency-domain representations of the signal (red dashed line) and the filtered signal (blue solid line). When on top of eachother, one can observe more regularity in the blue graph in the time-domain.\label{fig:DFT-IDFT}}
\end{figure}

% FFT
\subsection{Fast fourier transform}
The DFT takes $n^2$ operations to perform as there are $n$ outputs $X_k$ and $n$ amount of numbers are summed. A fast fourier transform is any method that speeds up the computation of the DFT. One of the more widely used algorithms, the Cooley-Tukey FFT, has an algorithmic complexity of $O(n log n)$ \cite{Randhawa2018} \cite{HeidemanEtAl1984}.
