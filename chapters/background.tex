\subsection{Fourier series and transform}
In the beginning of the 1800s, Joseph Fourier was working on a physics problem called the heat equation, a certain partial differential equation. He had the idea of expressing the original function as a sum of sine and cosine functions. He eventually developed and introduced the idea of Fourier series, a way of expressing a function as a sum of trigonometric functions. 

The if a function has a period of $2\pi$, the Fourier series takes the form $$f(t) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_ncos(nt)+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_nsin(nt)$$.

As an example at this point, the following $$\pi -2sin(x) -sin(2x) -\frac{2}{3}sin(3x) -\frac{1}{2}sin(4x) ... $$ is a sort of sawtooth wave.
