The purpose of this work was to explore frequency-domain approaches to pitch detection for use in real-time. It was constrained to be focus on giving feedback specifically for male (TTBB) singers. Using the theory created by Joseph Fourier in conjunction with more modern signal processing techniques such as the FFT and Harmonic Product Spectrum, the system can process an incoming stream to continuously estimate the fundamental frequency. A sampler is used to convert the continuous estimate stream to a sequence of notes which can be compared offline with Dynamic Time Warping or in real-time by forcing the user to be on pace with the sampler. The system works relatively accurately for monophonic inputs but falls short in certain aspects. The most common type of issue is an octave error, when multiple peaks remain after the HPS and the pitch detector can't know for certain which peak to choose. This shows that pitch detection is easy to get working, but difficult to get right. 

The product of this work is a JavaScript class and utility functions which could integrate in another application. The project repository contains a simple frontend that can be used to run the pitch detector.
