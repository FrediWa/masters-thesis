- White noise is just the inverse fourier transform of a straight line (all component frequencies in some range have the same amplitude)
- Nyqvist limit: sample/2
- A sequence of early papers [3, 11, 13, 14, 15] still serves as a good reference
for the DFT and FFT. https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Gentoomen%20Library/Information%20Theory/Compression/THE%20TRANSFORM%20AND%20DATA%20COMPRESSION%20HANDBOOK%20-%20K.R.%20RAO.PDF
- could add a chapter on pitch detection
